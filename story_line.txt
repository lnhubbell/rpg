the shadows around you shift from grey to true black. Every shadow feels like a deep lake, hiding worlds beneathe the surface. Almost as soon as it comes, the vision fades. But the feeling of power remains.

a rat pauses and looks up at you as it skitters past. It's larger than usual, but more unerving is the inteligence in its eyes. The creaure shivers, as if cold, and runs away.
